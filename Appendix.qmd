## Annoated LLM Response Comment 


I have ensured authenticity and relevance in the annotation process. I carefully reviewed the LLM outline, got the basic idea behind the concept, and annotated it based on personalization, skills, projects, aligning it with my actual academic and professional experience. I have used drafts as structured starting points and made generic revisions-

personalization - I have updated my professional experience and added real-time projects I have been working on to highlight my skills and experiences. I have listed projects such as AWS static site deployments, customer churn analysis, and work on under academic coursework.I have added other business projects, such as POpIN and an unsweetened organic marketing project, to highlight my skills on real-time projects. I have worked with different clients.

Contextual Editing - Some of the LLM phrases were edited for clarity and professionalism to simplify my tone. I have tried to edit in formal and more authentic, engaging phrases. 

Visual and Structural Changes - I have added sections like skills with different highlights of my technical and soft skills.I have removed unauthentic certifications listed in examples and only placed the authentic certifications completed by me.I have also included a logo of my own design created using Canva for maki	ng it look visually appealing. Also, I have styled the CSS page using the styling formatting and dark-themed style for a bold look.	

Accuracy Checks- I have only included the experience, skills or certification which I hold and haven‚Äôt included LLM-generated inputs.
