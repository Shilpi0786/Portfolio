## Breif Comment on Portfolio sources and ideas 

The LLM generated response was quite generic and a basic format required for portfolio building. I have taken the idea from the LLM response on highlighting education, skills and experiences from by own personal background choices and my key skills and technical skills. However, i have added sections like projects and certifications to provide my experience expersise based on my past experience and current skill enhancements . This choices make my portfolio a bold choice for market competetion and can be a key in standing out from rest.
